# Welcome To My Neighborhood!
This is a project done for Udacity's Front end nanodegree track. In this project I utilized the Google Maps and Wikipedia APIs to build an interactive map of one of my favorite places, Raleigh NC!

# How To Setup
Clone or download this project then cd into the directory and run NPM install and NPM start

Use the dropdown side bar at the top left hand corner to filter out some of my favorite places in Raleigh

Click on one of the markers or the name in the panel to view more information about the destination (info provided from the Wikipedia API)

Have fun exploring!
